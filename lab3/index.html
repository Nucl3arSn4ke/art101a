			<h1>Lab 3 - Subject/Topic</h1>
			<p>The idea of this lab was to further create local file structures
				on my computer and add index.html files.</p>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>It was easy to create the html files and keep them in order,
						because I enjoy keeping things organized. However, figuring
						out how to move the changes to the files from my local device 
						and tranferring them to the server took the most time.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem that I ran into was understanding how the commit
						function worked. I wasn't aware that I needed to intiate the 
						commit on my desktop github app before it would translate to
						the web page.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment went rather smoothly, but I do find myself
						questioning when certain code is needed, or if it is 
						redundant. Looking at the code and seeing working examples
						definitely helps, but I still find myself felling a bit
						lost at times with the code. I was able to troubleshoot
						the issues I was having and that gives me confidence to 
						make more progress in this course.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The results are right in front of you, I have completed the
						task I have set out to do. Here is my file structure.</p>
